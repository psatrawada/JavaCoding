Later you need to just pull and push :
To take latest changes on the code after first cloning:
Fetch and merge changes on the remote server to your working directory:
git pull origin master
Now do your coding in Java files  in your timezone, Once you finish the code changes you need to do below
git status - will give list of files modified
git add * - move files to staging
git commit -m â€œ committed in my timeâ€�
git push origin master

=====================================
If you get fatal error that means you are already into the logged into remote server so you donâ€™t need to specify it. otherwise use below command to set url
$git remote set-url origin https://github.com/psatrawada/MavenJava.git

git remote -v
Push the changes in your local repository to GitHub.
$ git push origin master
----------------------------------------------------------------------
You want to get someone elseâ€™s code from GITHUB to your local repository for the FIRST time, from  CLI go to your project location- C:\Users\dsatr\git-porkodi\  and do CLONING one time.
git clone https://github.com/psatrawada/Demo.git
